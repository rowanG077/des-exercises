  Description:

  In order to simulate the required situation we start the tasks inside the
  lower priority tasks. This will cause the tasks to start as soon as the call
  has been made. As nothing happens to prevent TODO

  Output:

  Low priority task locks semaphore
  Medium task running
  Medium task running
  High priority task tries to lock semaphore
  Medium task running

ex06b:
  Description:

  By using a mutex we enforce priorty inheritance. As can be seen in the output,
  after the high priority task first tries to obtain the lock, the low priority
  inherits the priority. The low priority task then starts running until it
  unlocks the semaphore after which its priority drops and the high priority
  task can complete its task. Once this is finished the medium task will start
  running until the end, followed by the low priority task.

  Output:

  Low priority task locks semaphore
