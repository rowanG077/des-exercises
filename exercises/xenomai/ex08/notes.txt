ex08a:
    Description

    The program ex08a generates a .csv file called 'ex08a.csv'. This file
    contains the measured data. '08a.pdf' contains a scatter plot of this data.
    In this plot we can see that, aside from some outliers in the first couple
    of measurements, the measured time difference is generally close to the task
    period. We have included the average nanoseconds in the file name, which in
    this run was 99989 ns.

ex08b:
    Description

    The program ex08b generates a .csv file called 'ex08b.csv'. Similar to
    ex08a, this file contains the measured data. The file
    'ex08b_worker_222332.csv' contains the measured data for when the worker
    task was included and the file 'ex0b_noworker_21852.csv' for when it wasn't.
    The files '08b-worker.pdf' and '08b-no-worker.pdf' contain the scatter plots
    of the respective data.

    As can be seen from the file names both version have an average interrupt
    latency of around 22200 ns. However, from the scatter plot we can see that
    the version where the worker task was running has some more outliers
    overall.
