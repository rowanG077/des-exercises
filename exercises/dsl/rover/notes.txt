DSL for small EV3 rover:

Develop a DSL to describe missions for the small EV3 robot with color,
ultrasonic and touch sensors.  Intended users of the DSL are high school students.

Examples of missions: find colors; follow line; avoid colors;
detect bottle; parking; …

Define grammar and generator for ev3dev Python code
(note: not all code need to be generated – similar to game of life).
Test it by defining a few instances in runtime workspace.
Note: focus on the DSL; code need not be perfect, can be improved later


Description:

  We have create a simple DSL that allows users to write a list of prioritized
  Behaviours. Each behaviour has a a trigger which we call `When` and a series
  of steps that are performed if the trigger is met and that behaviour is the
  one with the highest priority. Below is an example:

  Mission TestMission

  Behaviour StayInBounds
    Priority: 99
    When: ColorSensorReading Is Black
    Do:
      drive 50% backward
      wait 3 seconds
      turn 45 degrees right

  Behaviour AvoidDistance
    Priority: 98
    When: UltrasonicSensorReading < 50 cm
    Do:
      drive 50% backward
      wait 3 seconds
      turn 45 degrees right


	This file will generate a folder called "TestMission" with the files
	"StayInBounds.py" and "AvoidDistance.py". These can be used in our subsumption
  python architecture code. But we have not had the time yet to integrate this
  properly unfortunately. There is some validation on the DSL such that
  duplicate names and priorities are not possible. In the future we still want
  to add a simple type synthesizer and checker to ensure users don't generate
  malformed Behaviours.
